# Bayesian ETAS Simulation — R Markdown Project (Knit Result)

This repository hosts a knitted **R Markdown** (Rmd) report with figures embedded in the PDF. It demonstrates a Bayesian ETAS (Epidemic-Type Aftershock Sequence) simulation and model fitting workflow.

## 1) What’s included
- `code.pdf` — the knitted report (Rmd output) with code and figures
- `README.md` — this file
- *(Optional)* `report/ETAS_simulation.Rmd` — the source Rmd if available
- *(Optional)* `figures/` — exported figures if you choose to save them as images

## 2) Project goal
Simulate temporal earthquake catalogs, group by the count of high-magnitude events (≥ 5.0), visualize patterns, and fit Bayesian ETAS models with `ETAS.inlabru`.

## 3) Data/Simulation summary
- True parameters: μ = 0.1, K = 0.089, α = 2.29, c = 0.11, p = 1.08
- Time window: T ∈ [0, 1000], multiple synthetic catalogs
- Grouping by # of high-magnitude events: 0, 1–2, 3–4, 5+

## 4) How to reproduce (when Rmd is available)
If you add the Rmd later, install dependencies and render:
```r
install.packages(c("rmarkdown","ETAS.inlabru","ggplot2","gridExtra","dplyr","future"))
rmarkdown::render("report/ETAS_simulation.Rmd", output_format = "pdf_document")
```

### knitr options to keep figures
In your Rmd setup chunk you can force figures to save into `figures/`:
```r
knitr::opts_chunk$set(fig.path = "figures/", dpi = 300, fig.width = 7, fig.height = 4.5)
```

## 5) How to use this repo now (PDF-only)
You can publish the PDF as primary artifact and add screenshots to the README:
```markdown
📄 Full report (PDF): [code.pdf](./code.pdf)
```
*(Optional)* Export a few key figures from the PDF into `figures/` and embed:
```markdown
![Magnitude vs Time](./figures/mag_vs_time_sample1.png)
![Cumulative events](./figures/cum_events_sample1.png)
```

## 6) Suggested structure
```
ETAS-simulation/
├─ report/
│  └─ ETAS_simulation.Rmd        # add later if available
├─ figures/                      # saved by knitr when fig.path is set
├─ code.pdf                      # knitted output you have now
├─ .gitignore
└─ README.md
```
